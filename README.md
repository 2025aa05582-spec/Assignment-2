# d. Observations:
      1. LR performs the best out of all and Decision Tree is the weakest. This suggests linearly separable data.
      2. Ensmeble and XGBoost perform very well too, but not as much as LR.
      3. This implies classes are clearly separable and the data is also linear.
      4. KNN results also point to the fact that classes are distinctly separated.
